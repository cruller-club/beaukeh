# beaukeh

In 2018, the Federal government shutdown in the United States, and everyone in my office essentially got sent home.

The first thing I did was shut off all my television streaming services, because I was resolved not to turn into a show-binging zombie... Well, that's not true, I also had a mini freakout about our crumbling society. But then I cancelled Netflix or whatever.

The second thing I did was brainstorm up a little hack project to make all my computer backgrounds a bit more colorful. I was heavy on [D3](https://d3js.org) and [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) at the time, so that's how I first coded up `beaukeh`. I generated a couple hundred images, and they're still happily cycling on all my various screens.

Later that evening, I had a grand vision of a gallery with giant monitors all over the walls. The screens would show randomly-generated beaukehs and folks could point to ones they liked. I would then provide them with a high quality print, immediately cycle the beaus, and provide some cryptographic mechanism for proving the patron's image as unique. I didn't yet know it, but I was essentially thinking of a [non-fungible token (NFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token), which had arguably been invented about a year prior. This is something I probably could've quickly Googled and learned about, but I think I was waiting for a pizza to arrive and probably got distracted.

Fast forward to [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/), [OpenSea](https://opensea.io), and a super convenient [Coinbase Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/faq/) integration... And I decided to retool my super old Rails app into the thing I had briefly day-dreamed about before eating some delicious delicious pizza.
